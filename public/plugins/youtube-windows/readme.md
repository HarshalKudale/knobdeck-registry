# YouTube

YouTube live streaming controls in KnobDeck, on Windows and macOS.

## What it does

- Viewers: concurrent viewers of your live stream (updated every minute), "Offline" otherwise.
- Live Dashboard: opens YouTube Studio's live streaming page.

The plugin signs in **read-only**: it can see your channel and live stream, never change them.
Start and stop streams with the OBS plugin.

## Setup

Setup opens Google's sign-in page; choose the account that owns your channel and allow KnobDeck
to view your YouTube account.
If you use your own Google Cloud app (type Desktop, YouTube Data API enabled), enter its client ID
and secret in setup; they are kept only in KnobDeck's plugin data folder on this computer.

## How it works

The YouTube Data API with your Google sign-in. Every call counts against YouTube's daily API quota,
so the live keys refresh once a minute.

No client secret ships in the plugin. With KnobDeck's Google app, the code exchange and token
refresh go to the KnobDeck website (`KNOBDECK_GOOGLE_TOKEN_URL`, set at build time), which must:
accept the same form POST as `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token` (`grant_type`, `code`,
`redirect_uri`, `code_verifier`, `client_id`, or `refresh_token`), add `client_secret`, forward it to
Google and return Google's JSON reply unchanged.
